What is this:
A repo of scripts and config files I've created to control parts and spacecraft in Kerbal Space Program using Kerbal Operating System: https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS

Why does it exist:
Aside from fun, this project exists for me to practice and simulate creating tooling for a space flight organization using paradigmns common in industry including; git version control, semantic versioning, test driven development, agile (as logical as a team of one).

How is it organized:
  Test files:
  Mission files:
  Craft files: Assembler files
  Stage configs:

Example: Sounding Rocket
1. Create spacecraft
2. Create Assembler:
  1. Add loaders
    1. Science package
      1. File loaders
      2. Test files
    2. Engine package
  2. Staging logic
